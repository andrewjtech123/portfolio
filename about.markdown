# Hi there, I’m Andrew Johnston!
I'm a Senior Technical Editor at Blackberry QNX in Ottawa, based out of Aylmer and Wakefield, Quebec. I'm a Shopify Alum who worked at the company for a little over five years helping to build the API documentation team. I got my start in technical communications as employee number five of a startup in Montreal called Connexon Telecom; I was happy to grow and learn with that company as I wore many hats over ten years. The experience taught me a lot about startup culture and business in general, and it prepared me well for the rest of my career.

I’m passionate about documentation content quality and helping teams with the processes and procedures to raise and maintain the bar of quality. I'm a lifelong learner who loves to teach.

I prefer work that utilizes my expertise and industry knowledge and allows me to grow as a Senior Technical Editor and teammate.
